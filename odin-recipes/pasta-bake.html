            and cook pasta according to package instructions</li>
            <br>
            <li> While pasta is cooking, cook sausage in skillet <br>
            over medium heat until just lightly pink. Add green <br>
            bell pepper and onion to sausage. Continue cooking <br>
            until meat is cooked through. Add pepperoni, olives, <br>
